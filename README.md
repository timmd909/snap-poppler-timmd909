# snap-poppler-timmd909

Snap version of the latest poppler for use with legacy Ubuntu servers

I like using some [poppler](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/) utilities
for automating PDF regression tests. Unfortunately after Ubuntu 18.04,
the version of `poppler-utils` changes causing minor variations everywhere.

It's so annoying as it's the not all the letters are different. It's mostly
just the colons (`:`) and sometimes the antialiasing is off a bit.

Lastly, the one in Ubuntu 20.04 is still not the latest version released.
Might as well go with the latest possible, right?
